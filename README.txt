Good news!
==========

This repo started as a course project to achieve real-time tracking of the
UNMSM internal transport bus.

Eventually, the university obtained the permissions and announced that they
were looking for how to solve this problem.

We immediately proposed our project as a solution.

The project got accepted and the release is expected to happen in 2024-08-18.

We'll strive to keep the application and server open source. For now, the code
has been moved to official (private) repositories.

If that doesn't end up being the case, rest assured the API will remain open so
any student can build their own tracking solutions!
